        "p": "Ever since the beginning of my employment, my position was a part of the main company project. I worked in a team that designed a huge multilingual application which will deal with stocks. Upon my arrival in the company, the development of the application was in its beginning, thus allowing me to be a part of almost every segment of its development. My work involved layout development as well as constant backand data handling. I also worked on development od reusable UI components. My job mostly involved dinamic front-end components with many purposes, they performed various types of filtering, sortings, displays of dynamic data from backend etc. I constantly used React Js, Typescript, Redux/Saga/Toolkit/Injectors in the application development, as well as SCRUM/AGILE software development methodology.",
        "p2": "I was also involved in an independent project of my own - a dynamic banner which collected data from backend and, based on the data, changed its layout. I used vanila JS, SASS, AXIOS for this project.",
        "p3": "Before I stopped working in Teletrader, I was assigned to a sub-project for which I was personally responsible. I started working on the development of IO test application that would automatically test the main project. The test was supposed to have E2E testing and, if necessary, could be started only for a specific part of an organisation.",
        "p4": "Due to a new work organisation and COVID-19 impact on work, I was made redundant."
